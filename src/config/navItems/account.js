/***
 * These values are pulled in through the accountNavItems selector, which will map
 * each "to" value here to a corresponding route in "config/routes.js", if
 * one exists. This way, visibility of a navigation item will depend on the
 * corresponding route's "condition" function, so a user who doesn't have access
 * to /some/route will not see the nav item that points to /some/route
 *
 * Additionally, nav items can have their own conditions which also must be true
 * for the nav item to appear in the list. This is useful for nav items that
 * link to external URLs (e.g. docs) and for items that we may want to hide from
 * the nav without blocking access to the route wholesale (e.g. logout)
 *
 * Only "label" and "to" are required keys
 *
 * The "section" key here splits the final navigation into ordered groups
 * separated by a horizontal line separator
 *
 * The "icon" key here will right-align an icon when the item is displayed
